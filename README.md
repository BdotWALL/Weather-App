To count as completing this assignment, you will need to at least complete the base requirements. If you are planning to attempt the other requirements, read them all first so that you can better plan how you are going to set up your page and code. Be mindful of your time, if you attempt the other requirements but do not complete the basics, you will not get points for completion.
